 **Project Summary**
 
 The News Portal application is a sophisticated yet a very convenient app, which serves two purposes. Firstly, the purpose of showing the breaking headlines from around the world in real-time, along with the origin location of the publisher in a map. Secondly, this app can also be used for viewing headlines based on search terms, also with the functionality of accessing the original host link for a specific news. With a minimalistic UI (user-interface), this app can be considered user-friendly.
